The basic rule introduced at the beginning of the lecture is “factually correctness”. I agree with the suggestion of “write what you want to write”, but it can be said that the foremost goal of the media is simply to make a profit by maximizing audience.   
Moreover, people tend to get the most interest in two categories of news: one is abnormal that satisfies curiosity and snooping desire, the other is “sure things” that coincidence with people’s recognition of current structure and form.  
Therefore, to satisfy people and gain profits, sometimes journalism has to be obedient to restrains. There is no panacea but tradeoffs.  

Also, regarding “factually correctness”, there is unavoidable personal and emotional bias. A current example is Black Box from Shiori Ito, who is criticized for being subjective about her experience, although traumatic, instead of objectively recording the neutral fact. Therefore, the liability of information and credibility of the report is what needs to be proved aside from the attractiveness of the report itself.  
What is more ironic is that untruthfulness is avoided in the west but encouraged in China. A former reporter in CCTV is so famous for revealing the truth of transgenesis foods under authority’s control, that he eventually lost the job within the bureaucracy system and had to carry on his investigation personally. Undoubtedly, connections and investigation with both domestic and abroad institutions is a financial burden, as a result, monetary support from institutions other than national ones is a must. So the escape from preconception only drove him to another existence of prejudice. As we can see, report about sensitive topics can be strictly under control, not to mention the difficulties of moderateness.  

Within the discussion by Mr Denyer, he mentioned, "I feel a responsibility to reveal the fact for those people". However, according to Chinese people’s understanding of democracy, there does exist the awareness of restricted liberty of speech but too often are they satisfied with given information and partial truth, that eventually dilutes the impulse to improve the situation.
