Resume of Chapter 5: Separating Economy from Politics? Japan’s Coexistence Strategy with Two Chinas in the 1960s 
Reference: Seung-Hee Oh and Eunbong Choi, “Separating Economy from Politics? Japan’s Coexistence Strategy with Two Chinas in the 1960s,” The Korean Journal of International Studies, Vol.13-2 (August 2015), 411-429. 

1. Background  
1949: establishment of the PRC, “One China” principle: improvement of relations with PRC directly meant diplomatic cessation with ROC  
1963: “Seikei Bunri”, by Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan  
1972: Japan diplomatic normalization with PRC (cessation with ROC)  

2. International relationships  
(1)	Japan  
a.	With the US  
+: economy concentration: treaty of Security and Safeguard Between Japan and United States  
-: under control (since WWII) -> Decline of sovereignty and power of speech  
b.With PRC (People’s Republic of China)  
+: a market with a population of 700 million   
-: liberalistic bloc and COCOM(Coordinating committee for export control to Communist Areas)  
* Nagasaki flag incident (1958)   
* Senkaku/Diaoyudao disputes  

c.With ROC (Republic of China)  
+: US’s China policy  
		criticism from international society against the PRC (nuclear experiment); Failure of entering into the UN  
-: “One China” policy  
The PRC’s increasing diplomatic relations establishment and exchanges with Asian countries  
Controversies: political position with US & trade with PRC  
->	Separation of politics and economics  
->	?  

3. Analyzing method  
“Diplomatic Bluebook”   
PRC-international +: The Japanese government admitted that the PRC had a significant position in the international stage  
PRC-international -: The Japanese government judged that the PRC’s international relations had been worsened  
JP-PRC +: positive political relations between Japan and the PRC  
JP-PRC -: negative political relations between Japan and the PRC  
JP-ROC +: positive political relations between Japan and the ROC  
JP-ROC -: negative political relations between Japan and the ROC  
Independent variable | trend | Export to PRC | Imports from PRC | Trend of Japan-PRC trade | proportion
-------------------- | ----- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------
PRC-international | + | ↑ | ↓ | ↓ | ↓ | ↓
PRC-international | –	| ↓ | ↓	| ↑ | ↓ | ↑
JP-PRC(+) | + | ↑ | ↑ | ↑ | ↑ | ↑
JP-PRC(-) | – | ↑ | ↓ | ↓ | ↓ | ↑
JP-ROC(+) | + | ↑ | ↑ | ↑ | ↑ | ↑
JP-ROC(-) | - | ↓ | ↓ | ↓ | ↓ | ↓
1st & 2nd: exports to PRC could not easily be increased regardless of PRC-international relationship  
 But in some cases, increased -> importance overweight  
3rd & 4th: in the same trend. Separation -> inseparable  
? proportion of trade with the PRC increased even during periods of negative relations  
		Hypothesis: hiding real purpose (economic development) under mask (political condemn)  
? JP-ROC’s highest correlation   
		Few remarks before 1962  
		Increase after 1962  
1958: Nagasaki flag incident -> 4-year stagnation  
1962: L-T Trade: PRC’s deputy director of the State Council’s Office of Foreign Affairs, and Japan’s former member of the House of Representatives of Japan of the Liberal Democratic Party  

The Japanese government increased remarks, both on the PRC and on the ROC  
			On the ROC: co-existence  
			On the PRC: persuade the US  

Own comments:

(1)	Necessity (objective)  
controlled by the US  
Diplomacy with ROC  
(2)	Sufficiency (subjective)  
Trade  

5. Results  
(1)Advantages
Impetus  
(2)Disadvantages  
barrier  

6. Conclusion  
The separation is an evidence of inseparable relationship between politics and economy  
Politicians?  
Conscious: 
* Sensed that government was not 100% strict  
* Given acquiescence by the government  
Randomly:  
* Benefits >> risk.
