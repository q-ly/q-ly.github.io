The significant proportion for me is the introduction of universal principles, the state's capacities and ambitions of the country.  
What is also important is how philosophers explain the basic principle and fundamental rights that are equal to every individual.  
As a student in the department of political science and economy, I'm especially interested in the way that liberalism guides French politics, as well as the process in which regime, state and nation are established.   

### Questions:  
1. How can France act as a model and spread its philosophy to the world?  
Diversity exists among regimes; therefore, the model may not fit in all circumstances. In monarchy countries, such as Japan, Britain and ancient China, there is an unchangeable concept that king, or emperor, holds sovereign power, and the statue is well above normal people. As a result, equality for all individuals is impossible in these countries. How can France act as a model for the world in this situation?  

2. How can equality and fraternity be estimated and verified?  
As a capitalist country which values private ownership and property rights, there is without doubt class polarization, according to Karl Marx. A remarkable characteristic of capitalism is that the state is based on the capitalist appropriation of means of production, and the oppressing class earn profit through the exploitation of the oppressed class. Fraternity may exist in one class, e.g., the proletariats, but does not sound plausible from aristocracy to lower social ranks. Therefore, "Equality" is hard to be reached extensively, neither can "Fraternity" be satisfied. By what means can the two principles consistent with capitalism and private ownership?  

3. How can people's loyalty to the regime remain?  
Religion is a powerful method to keep people's loyalty to a regime. In Britain, people believe in the Queen; in Japan, people devote to the emperor; although China doesn't have a countrywide religion, nearly all of the government consists of communists, and people have a sense of belonging to the party; and in the U.S., people, despite ethnicity diversity, have faith on chances and equal opportunities.  
According to former questions, it's hard to see equality and fraternity identified, not to mention cohesion. What makes all people shout "VIVE LA FRANCE"?

4. P.09, "A need for 'incarnation' >> 'l'homme providentiel'"  
Both words are hard to understand. I searched and got "incarnation" refers to a symbol of an abstract item, such as a regime, a sovereign or a state; and "l'homme providentiel" means a person with responsibilities given by a higher will, such as a God.  
I wonder if you take this point here to illustrate that the governer of France is no longer an almighty supreme being but a central processing existence to optimize interests?

### Comments:
1. For question 3, my assumption is that people's loyalty to the regime is dim, reflecting on the strong rebellious tradition in France. People don't hold full confidence and belief in the sovereign, therefore, objection and dissent are frequent.

2. The definition of liberty is not valid enough.  
According to P.06, "Article IV - Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others (...)", it is macroscopically convincible, since murder and pilferage are unacceptable in all regimes. However, "does not harm others" is a vague identification.   
For example, the government forced a drugster into rehab, and after his recovery, he accused the government for overusing liberty. Since the usage of drug is out of the desire to escape from emotional harm and physical illness, the action of forcing him to get rid of addiction is more than harm to him. In this perspective, the state has no right to be involved in personal affairs.  
Also, some fundamental rights are exclusive. Take an isolated, unowned land as an example, my declaration on the ownership of this piece of land undoubtedly takes away others' possibility of owning this certain land. Is this deprivation equals to harm?   
Or, suppose A and B are a match, but A falls in love with C, without written contracts such as engagement or marriage, does A and C have the liberty to be a new match at the cost of harming B, or does A's rights are restricted to keep the original relationship despite harm on A and C?  
I suppose the last discussion is more to ethics, but the property aspect is worth consideration.

The most significant point for me is the introduction to amalgamation and emancipation of political power and religious power. From the lecture, I learnt that at around 496, Clovis, the king of Franks decided to convert to Christianism to fight rivals at that time; and at 1572, religion-oriented civil war busted in France, which led to a big trauma and resulted in the Edict of Nantes.   


### Questions：  
1. Does the emancipation of political power and religious power inevitable, or are the dismissals randomly and spontaneously take place?  
Regarding the current totalitarianism situation in Iran, as long as the religion is combined with military force, the possibility of civil war, similar to that in France, is small. Will control of the army be a strong advantage of the regime? What would happen in 1572 if Henri IV or his counterpart held more forces?  
The situation in Iran is also similar to that in China: leader of ideology is also the leader of military force. This is undoubtedly a stronger regime than the domestic separation of power, like checks and balances. Which one can be regarded as a more advanced political institution?  
 
 
2. Why did Charlemagne’s govern be regarded as “Charlemagne Renaissance”?  
Since Renaissance aimed at overthrowing restrictions from the church and spreading liberalism, it is clearly contradictory to what Charlemagne wants, referred to everyone thinking and acting the same way in the Empire.  
Or, was the “Renaissance” only pointed out that Charlemagne’s simulation of ancient Rome?  
 
3. How was Clovis able to beat local rivals?  
From the lecture, I learnt that Clovis, king of the Franks, changed his belief to Christianism to cooperate with the church to beat the rivals. How was he able to do that? Was it because that Christianism was the largest power at that time, or was Christianism somehow more advantageous than other religions?   
Also, how was the sacred chrism able to persuade the people to swear allegiance to a newly devotee?   
 
### Comments:  
1.	Seeking help and ally from religions, as mentioned above, is commonly seen in the histories of many countries. In Japan, Hirohito made an attempt to control both political power and religious power; the situation in England (1534-1660) is also similar. However, the most pious, in other words, the one that has the most intimate bond with religions, regime had eventually abandoned spiritual power or dismissed the religious chairman. The reason could be civil war from religion conflicts (like France) or the awareness of the threat from bishops.  

2.	Sometimes a common enemy to many tribes can be an aggregation force for all individuals to merge. Like the alliance of hundreds of tribes against the Roman invasion, the threat of external enemy outweighed conflicts between tribes. It couldn’t be denied that Rome's invasion accelerated the conjunction of small groups, but a concerted target can maximize people’s awareness of similarity while ignoring the differences.   
This can be a strategy of cultural unification and association. Both China and France used the same means in national songs, China’s refers to “Arise! Many hearts with one mind, beat the enemy’s bonfire and march on, march on!”, while France’s writing “To arms, citizens, Form your battalions, let’s march!”. By creating an ethnically joint enemy that requires the association of all individuals to resist, regardless of class, ethnic and personal grudge, a fancy feeling can inspire people’s motivation to fight for a more macroscopical goal is created, although imaginary.  
Same manner is implemented in 1984, from George Orwell. It is plausible to assume that Oceania created Eastasia and Eurasia, at least some battle results, to create an altogether target of emotion for people to strengthen the patriotism and weaken egotism. It is convenient and riskless to guide people’s aggressiveness and hostility, as well as other natural, negative feelings, towards an enemy from the outside world, instead of leaving the aggressive impulse develop into crime pointing inside the unity.  
This idea may be rebutted by Socratic or followers of Rousseau and Locke, who claims that human, by nature, is “No one desires evil”, or believes that human’s basic motivation is to respect others’ rights or the repugnance at seeing others’ suffering. However, when faced with a joint army, even the mildest, obedient citizen can be inspired to be the executant of catastrophe. The Auschwitz and the Nanjing Massacre can be convincing evidence of the existence of aggregation.  
In practice, rather than propagandizing the ideology of virtue and mutual kindness, creating an unreal enemy to abreact desires which are incompatible to modern society may be more effective a way to turn barbarians to polite citizens.

This lecture, with the topic of 1789 revolution, discussed details, reasons and consequences about the first revolution. I’m interested in different perspectives and emphasizes from various political parties, including the ambition to create equality but with limits, beginning of new economy, and some regard the revolution as the destruction of tradition. They all explain the political movement insight of own interests.  

Another thing that appears attractive to me is the process of the revolution. Firstly, the people only desired the privileged, namely first and second, to pay taxes the same as the mass population. Even though the first two classes made a concession, the taxation would still be sufficient enough to continue the fiscal system. As time goes by, negotiation failed and political conflict updated and armed forces involved, the revolution turned from a change to a zero-sum game.  

### Comments:  
We can assume that, although by milder method, the anarchy hierarchy can survive longer, fundamental controversies would finally burst out. However, if the nobility hadn’t thrown weapons into political affairs, or if Louis XVI accepted a weakened power instead of fleeing in search for military support, French may develop in a different way, with a nominal king like the UK, and separation of executive, legislative and judicial.   

### Questions:
1.	I’m curious about the different political parties you mentioned at the beginning of the lecture.  
I understand left-wing focus more on personal rights and individual equality, but what about the difference between liberal right-wing and conservative right-wing? Does the “deconstruction of traditions”, referring to the main critics from the conservative right-wing, means that they prefer nostalgias monarchy instead of modern democracy? Also, what does “modern economy” that you mentioned when describing the liberal right wing’s opinion means? Since France have long been benefited by free trade and low tariff, I suppose it means less taxation in the domestic market, as the mass population fought for.  

2.	On p.14, you mentioned “relative weakening of State power since the death of Louis 14th”. Did this weakening come from external threat and internal discontentment, or did this phenomenon come from theories of public philosophers, such as Rosseau and Montesquieu?   
Also, what exactly does this description means? The lack of ability to accumulate taxation?  

3.	On p.7, you mentioned “in the name of traditions and/or new liberal ideas”, does it mean that at that time, tradition and liberty are just different names describing the same thing, namely, with necessary concession, and preserve as much as possible an aristocratic monarchy? Or is the “tradition” means long-existing hierarchy and “liberty” refers to proclaims for equality and respect to individual freedom?  

4.	On p.10, you mentioned that in the “Tiers Etat”, there were no peasants. Were they excluded from the conference? Or were the farmers’ education too inferior to participate? Or they took no interest in such rights-protecting political movement?  

5.	Why the Republican calendar was created in 1792, and why it was cancelled by Napoleon? Is there a ceremonial meaning, just like Japan’s changing era name from “Akihito” to “Reiwa”?  

6.	The fall of Robespierre, according to the lecture, due to a change of majority at the convention nationale. I wonder what was the change and why it happened. Did people begin to be fed with violence and sought for a peaceful transition?  

## 06 06-09
This lecture, giving a brief biography of Napoleon 1st, revealed a general perspective of the life span of not only this person but also his profound influence on France. I learnt that not only the emperor conquered a mass religion of Europe and enormously largened French territories, but also trialled to proceed a consolidated code, as well as unified language and currency throughout the Europa. Although politically, he betrayed democracy, ignoring it was indeed the revolution, which concentrated on democracy, that brought the empereur success and victory, his legacy still flourished France undoubtedly.  

### Comments:  
1.	Emphasizing victory and similarity is a useful political method of diluting difference and winning cohesion.   

2. In the perspective of a Chinese, it’s surprising that French, proud as their identification of the Gauls, could accept a foreigner as the leader of militaries and eventually empereur. China, nowadays known of consisting 56 ethnics, was once ruled by Genghis Khan, who was a glorious Mongol conqueror similar to Napoleon, and the area of China dramatically expanded accompanied by great respect and fear from surrounding regions and areas during his dominance; and another famous emperor, named Kangxi, a descendant of Manchu invaders who brought China not only unprecedented wealth but also external respect by cross-region trade and business. However, neither of the two emperors gained as honourable a fame as Napoleon, with one of the reasons as not coming from Han ethnic, and being regarded “alien” as a result. 

### Questions:  
1.	Napoleon practised totalitarianism under his centralized governance, did this centralization of power contradicts with the constitutions and separation of powers, namely the primacy of laws as Legacy of the Revolution and Empire?  
It’s regarded that under the personal military, executive powers were enhanced dramatically widely beyond the legitimate range, while legislation and judicial became nothing but forms without actual power.   

2.	What opinions do French people have towards the retrogress of democracy during Napoleon’s domination?  
As for Napoleon, he hitchhiked the Revolution and earned support as a general of democracy camp, but later on betrayed his proclaim, implemented the authoritarian regime and eventually governor France through monarchy, not to mention even winning life-long glory honoured by the parliament.  
In China, there is also a torchbearer named Mao who ended the civil war and enforced totalitarianism afterwards during his dominance. Although centralized power benefited the disrupted situation by reforming a strong authority and stabilizing domestic circumstance, this policy is still under discussion without a commonly accepted praise.   

3.	Why, as mentioned in the lecture, did his death on Saint-Helena expanded his legend?  

4.	How did the propaganda of Napoleon work?  
More specifically, why the painting, the coronation of Napoléon 1st, by Jacques-Louis David (1806) was considered propaganda of Napoleon?  
Was the reason of showing power and stateliness of the empereur?  

5. The sentence mentioned in the lecture, “Bonaparte flies like lightning and strikes like thunder. He is everywhere and sees everything”, was stated to be written by himself. However, according to Napoleon: A Concise Biography, by David Avrom Bell, this sentence was from one of the French-language newspaper, aiming at radical “neo-Jacobins”, founded by Napoleon to report on his conquests.  
From my personal viewpoint, the controversies require more explanation.

From lecture 7, I learnt about the change of political institutions in France during the 19th century. As the first cycle of Monarchy-Republic-Empire took place from 1789 to 1815, French politics itself repeated this cycle, started as a  monarchy born from restoration, to 2nd republic, and to 2nd empire in 1815 whose personal governance continued all the way to 1870. Mostly, the dictator of the monarchy became too radical and intolerant, therefore, revolution burst aiming at revolting the autarchy. Unlike the former 1st revolution that brought the political system from monarchy to the republic, the 2nd revolution in 1830 didn’t change political institutions but changed the leader, and substantial consistency of monarchy remained. It was socialism and social issues that urged the 3rd revolution that altered French politics from monarchy to republic.  
At the 1st presidential election of the Second Republic, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte won the place with a legacy of Napoleon the 1st. to extend his mandate, Napoleon the 3rd carried on 2nd Coup D’etat to form his empire out of the republic, same as 1st Coup D’etat which built the 1st Empire from the 1st Republic. With an authoritarian empire, he developed economy and improved working conditions, along with liberal turn in the 1860s. However, he was defeated by various war during his dominance, as a result, the 3rd Republic has proclaimed as well as the dismissal of Napoleon 3rd.  
What is most interesting to me is that all leaders of the Republic seem to have a willing to lengthen the tenure, and the leader of the Republic of China also regulated the constitution, abolished 4-year fixed term of office restraint of the president to lifelong service. It may be a universal tendency of a leader to hold political power as long as possible.  
However, what is different between China and France is that in China it is the party that dominants instead of personal dictatorship. With a strong party in power, the strict rules and regulations of manpower within the party itself can be sufficient to keep a leader long enough on the political stage, without risking the decline of personal judgement and radicalization, like Charles X.  


### Questions:
1.	Is the difference between a monarchy and an empire the tolerance of liberal aspects, or the election?  
From the slides introducing monarchy and empire, it shows that both monarchy and empire take the form of personal dictatorship. However, monarchy focuses on acceptations of liberal aspects while there is political modernization in the empire. From this aspect, they seem to be similar.  
What also confuses me is that since elections in the empire are just formalized to ensure the legitimacy of dictatorship, what is the difference between empire monarchy?  

2.	Why the Restoration aimed to erase revolution instead of the 1st empire?
On the time scale, what came before the Restoration was the 1st Empire. I don’t understand why the Restoration didn’t take erasing the 1st empire as a goal.  

3.	How do we define the innovations of the Restoration as freedom of press and opinion?  
In the lecture, it was mentioned that anyone who criticized god of the king got punished. Besides, Bonapartists and republicans are forbidden from spreading public opinions. So how do we define the increase of public opinion freedom in this period?  

In the lecture, it was mentioned that anyone who criticized god of the king got punished. Besides, Bonapartists and republicans are forbidden from spreading public opinions. So how do we define the increase of public opinion freedom in this period?  
4.	Why “on billion to emigrants” is defined as a revenge of the nobility?  
In the lecture, it was mentioned that anyone who criticized god of the king got punished. Besides, Bonapartists and republicans are forbidden from spreading public opinions. So how do we define the increase of public opinion freedom in this period?  

5.	Why the time for political change is much swifter in the second cycle than in the first one?  

6.	Did Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte have any specific political goal, or just borrowed his uncle’s frame?  
I think at least he needed some kind of propaganda, or claim of a governance plan, to win support. Even “make France great again” could be possible.  

## 08 06-23
What impressed me the most was the longevity of the 3rd republic. Instinctively, anarchy, or personal dominance, can be stable and direct, and regime change only by replacing the highest authority with one another rather than shaking the whole political institution upside down. However, the seeming chaos and unstable Republic survived the longest time throughout France history.  
The lecture, as a continuation of the introduction of the 2nd Empire, talked about the 3rd republic. The positive side of this period is its longevity, renewal of political system, and development of not only science but also education. However, there also exist shades, since the parliament created little but a curtain for different political ideologies to seemingly coexist, and what came after the golden age was the WWI and fascism.  
For political power, at this time, the parliament acted against personalization of power and personal leader, in order to avoid kingship and emperor. The strongest parliament controlled both legislation and execution by controlling the president who was elected by the parliament. Besides unchallengeable power, the parliament, totally elected from the people, by the people and for the people, helped people to form a habit of voting.  

### Comments:
1. It’s surprising to learn that people in the 3rd republic still had the enthusiasm to vote in regard to the huge number of small cities. I thought that too many candidates and voting activities would lower people’s willingness to take part in political action, not only because only a small part, sometimes only 1, of those cities was directly relevant to their daily lives, but also one person’s vote would be unlikely to make a difference in a massive number of electoral activities. The high frequency of election could result in frustration and tiredness of citizens.  
However, nowadays in France, according to a reporting in 2014, the voting rate in France was only 55.04%, much lower than described in the lecture.   

2. It was interesting to learn that similar political changes took place in France and Japan at a similar time. Perhaps it shows that human beings have similar desire when politics and economics get developed at a similar level.  

3. The blossom of science and education, with the development of urban planning and transportation construction, reminds me of the governance of Louis XIV. Rationalization of higher education and city building is only achievable when the regime is confident enough of its dominance.  

4. Before the worldwide war, different politicism can work together, but in the face of an enemy too strong to defend, differences will drive the alliance to a separation.  

### Questions:

1. In the lecture, it was mentioned that “women were more left-wing than men, which was a reason for not allowing women to vote”. Could you make a further explanation of this phenomenon? Did it reveal that the parliament was not as includable as it was described?  
2. According to the introduction of the international exhibition, why the Eiffel Tower wasn’t destroyed as planned? How did the “showoff” landmark become a symbol for Paris, even France and the ethnic group?  
3. I’m suspicious about the statement talked about in the lecture, “France see people without a difference if they have received an education”. Does this contradict with the racism later mentioned?  
4. I also doubt the effectiveness of education in eliminating racism and discrimination. If generalizing a certain unique characteristic into specific quality can be solved with education, why are Japanese people, even expand to Asian people, still have a tacit admiration of the White with a relatively high rate of compulsory education? Even those with higher education can have some sense of unknown stereotype of ethnic groups, therefore, I don’t regard education as a solution to this problem.  
5. Why Petain explained that he was a “shield” protecting France from the inside, even with the fact that he was nothing but a puppet leader for a fake government, fundamentally controlled by the Nazi regime?  


## 09 07-01
The most interesting part in lecture number 9 is the ideology of “public monarchy”, which talks about the current final stage of France politics, named “the fifth republic”. It was created in the 1950s, in the trauma after World War II, in an unstable and fragile period where France just escaped from the Nazi regime and transferred to the fourth republic. as Moral crisis of lost glory grew, as France was losing international influence at that time, as well as the decreasing interest in colonization, people desired for a political institution that is capable of representing people’s will.  
The fifth republic, as an apolitical success, remains a stable institution regardless of alternation and changes of governments by emphasizing presidents’ powers and introducing competition. However, this method also faces challenges for making politics a game for professionals and the increase of people’s dissatisfaction at big parties, resulting in the success of Macron in the current election.  
As a symbiosis connecting elements of republican, monarchy and imperial philosophy, the 5th republic takes the measure of selecting a president from all citizens beyond political parties and divisions to ensure fairness and equality. The president is so powerful that not only does he has the power to resolve the lower house but also the key to the most powerful weapons in France. After the Resolution, the election of the president is always earlier than the election of the constitution to make sure the president follows his promise, as well as the designation of prime mister, who is in charge of making a government that composites members from different political sides.  

### Comments:
The dissatisfaction of political leaders being unable to fulfil promises has been a mass topic globally. Since people regard governments as no longer capable of solving problems, independent candidates, like Macron and Trump, has come to power. However, not only “governing on Twitter” policy of Trump and his attitude towards the black infuriated Americans, but also Macron was criticized by the arrogance of elites and not keeping his promise as fighting against inequality. Therefore, it is foreseeable that in the next election, people would still turn to large, oligopoly political parties to compensate the dissatisfaction from free-lancer politicians.   

### Question:
1.	Could you explain more about “president controls power but prime minister owns it”? Does it mean that although in name the prime minister is the person who is legally admitted using the power, but in reality, mainly the president exercises by advising the prime minister?

2.	It was mentioned in the lecture that the president is the arbitrator who can exercise power unjudged. However, as illegal actions, for example, corruptions and scandals take place, will the president still able to continue his term of office?

3.	Why was the left-wing criticizing the fifth republic as “face monopoly”? And why did they regard the institutions as being controlled by a republican power and conservative government?

4.	Why it is often the case that a candidate has to specific difference between him and the former president? Does this reveal that people are unsatisfied at all presidentiable people as soon as they become presidents, or it is just a regular cycle that once people hold power instead out of the declaration, they corrupt to eat their words?

What interested me the most was the marriage institutions in France. The lecture first introduced marriage trends comparing Japan and France, mentioning similarities that in France and Japan, annual number of marriages tends to decrease, age of spouses at first marriage has both increased, so as the age of the mother at first childbirth and share of births outside of marriage especially after 1979. However, there still exist differences. Age of spouses at first marriage in France is about 2 years older than that in Japan, the difference is nearly the same for the age of the mother at first childbirth. Women tend to have the first child after about one year of the first marriage in Japan, but French women are experiencing 4 years earlier of first childbirth than the first marriage since 1993. Also, the share of births outside of marriage is much larger in France than in Japan.  
The problem with the low marriage rate in France has several reasons. First, French people tend to have a more open recognition towards marriage and childbearing, since marriage is not expected of couples having children but viewed separately. This can be clarified from international comparison conducted in 2010 when only 33.6% of French answered an obvious positive attitude of marriage, while the number was 75.9% in Japan.  
Secondly, the proceed of PACS is by some means a substitute for marriage. This form of social contract has only inheritance rights, alimony and survivor’s pension benefits different from marriage. Therefore, it replaced marriage in some extents, which resulted in a decreasing rate of marriage.  
French people are experiencing more diversified methods of personal relationships. The traditional path of marriage followed by birthrate is not as popular as the popularity in Asian countries. Cohabitation can voluntarily step into marriage, PACS, or simply continue the form of togetherness, people can choose life paths and partners out of personal preference with fewer restrictions and stereotypes from the society.  

### Comments:
1.	China is still not encouraging childbirth without marriage. Although the situation has been improved these years, since infants are allowed to be registered permanent residence without certification of the marriage of parents, however, the parent or parents will be charged twice the amount of money as social compensation fee than children born with a certificate.  
In China, both homosexual marriage and PACS do not exist. Living together without an official approve, such as marriage, is regarded not only abnormal but also immoral.  
2.	I regard the priority or say governmental preference allocated to marriage and PACS is the tradeoff between freedom and balance. It’s true that PACS can offer a high quality of education to the next generation nearly the same as marriage, but there exists a potential risk for PACS and marriage seems to be more stable with the restriction and duties. Therefore, marriages tend to be preferred compared to PACS by the government.  

### Question:
1.	What social benefits does marriage occupy comparing to PACS?  
2.	Why spouses, with a marriage certificate, can enjoy tax benefits? If it’s only for childbearing, why not the nation just collect children takes a large part, if not all, responsibilities of raising the next generation? In this way, not only professional experts at education can be gathered with the power of a whole nation, but people can choose whether or not to take the responsibility of childbearing. therefore, there must be something more than simply childbearing that touches the interest of the whole society.
