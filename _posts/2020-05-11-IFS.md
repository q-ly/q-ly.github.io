The significant proportion for me is the introduction of universal principles, the state's capacities and ambitions of the country.  
What is also important is how philosophers explain the basic principle and fundamental rights that are equal to every individual.  
As a student in the department of political science and economy, I'm especially interested in the way that liberalism guides French politics, as well as the process in which regime, state and nation are established.   

### Questions:  
1. How can France act as a model and spread its philosophy to the world?  
Diversity exists among regimes; therefore, the model may not fit in all circumstances. In monarchy countries, such as Japan, Britain and ancient China, there is an unchangeable concept that king, or emperor, holds sovereign power, and the statue is well above normal people. As a result, equality for all individuals is impossible in these countries. How can France act as a model for the world in this situation?  

2. How can equality and fraternity be estimated and verified?  
As a capitalist country which values private ownership and property rights, there is without doubt class polarization, according to Karl Marx. A remarkable characteristic of capitalism is that the state is based on the capitalist appropriation of means of production, and the oppressing class earn profit through the exploitation of the oppressed class. Fraternity may exist in one class, e.g., the proletariats, but does not sound plausible from aristocracy to lower social ranks. Therefore, "Equality" is hard to be reached extensively, neither can "Fraternity" be satisfied. By what means can the two principles consistent with capitalism and private ownership?  

3. How can people's loyalty to the regime remain?  
Religion is a powerful method to keep people's loyalty to a regime. In Britain, people believe in the Queen; in Japan, people devote to the emperor; although China doesn't have a countrywide religion, nearly all of the government consists of communists, and people have a sense of belonging to the party; and in the U.S., people, despite ethnicity diversity, have faith on chances and equal opportunities.  
According to former questions, it's hard to see equality and fraternity identified, not to mention cohesion. What makes all people shout "VIVE LA FRANCE"?

4. P.09, "A need for 'incarnation' >> 'l'homme providentiel'"  
Both words are hard to understand. I searched and got "incarnation" refers to a symbol of an abstract item, such as a regime, a sovereign or a state; and "l'homme providentiel" means a person with responsibilities given by a higher will, such as a God.  
I wonder if you take this point here to illustrate that the governer of France is no longer an almighty supreme being but a central processing existence to optimize interests?

### Comments:
1. For question 3, my assumption is that people's loyalty to the regime is dim, reflecting on the strong rebellious tradition in France. People don't hold full confidence and belief in the sovereign, therefore, objection and dissent are frequent.

2. The definition of liberty is not valid enough.  
According to P.06, "Article IV - Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others (...)", it is macroscopically convincible, since murder and pilferage are unacceptable in all regimes. However, "does not harm others" is a vague identification.   
For example, the government forced a drugster into rehab, and after his recovery, he accused the government for overusing liberty. Since the usage of drug is out of the desire to escape from emotional harm and physical illness, the action of forcing him to get rid of addiction is more than harm to him. In this perspective, the state has no right to be involved in personal affairs.  
Also, some fundamental rights are exclusive. Take an isolated, unowned land as an example, my declaration on the ownership of this piece of land undoubtedly takes away others' possibility of owning this certain land. Is this deprivation equals to harm?   
Or, suppose A and B are a match, but A falls in love with C, without written contracts such as engagement or marriage, does A and C have the liberty to be a new match at the cost of harming B, or does A's rights are restricted to keep the original relationship despite harm on A and C?  
I suppose the last discussion is more to ethics, but the property aspect is worth consideration.

The most significant point for me is the introduction to amalgamation and emancipation of political power and religious power. From the lecture, I learnt that at around 496, Clovis, the king of Franks decided to convert to Christianism to fight rivals at that time; and at 1572, religion-oriented civil war busted in France, which led to a big trauma and resulted in the Edict of Nantes.   


### Questions：  
1. Does the emancipation of political power and religious power inevitable, or are the dismissals randomly and spontaneously take place?  
Regarding the current totalitarianism situation in Iran, as long as the religion is combined with military force, the possibility of civil war, similar to that in France, is small. Will control of the army be a strong advantage of the regime? What would happen in 1572 if Henri IV or his counterpart held more forces?  
The situation in Iran is also similar to that in China: leader of ideology is also the leader of military force. This is undoubtedly a stronger regime than the domestic separation of power, like checks and balances. Which one can be regarded as a more advanced political institution?  
 
 
2. Why did Charlemagne’s govern be regarded as “Charlemagne Renaissance”?  
Since Renaissance aimed at overthrowing restrictions from the church and spreading liberalism, it is clearly contradictory to what Charlemagne wants, referred to everyone thinking and acting the same way in the Empire.  
Or, was the “Renaissance” only pointed out that Charlemagne’s simulation of ancient Rome?  
 
3. How was Clovis able to beat local rivals?  
From the lecture, I learnt that Clovis, king of the Franks, changed his belief to Christianism to cooperate with the church to beat the rivals. How was he able to do that? Was it because that Christianism was the largest power at that time, or was Christianism somehow more advantageous than other religions?   
Also, how was the sacred chrism able to persuade the people to swear allegiance to a newly devotee?   
 
### Comments:  
1.	Seeking help and ally from religions, as mentioned above, is commonly seen in the histories of many countries. In Japan, Hirohito made an attempt to control both political power and religious power; the situation in England (1534-1660) is also similar. However, the most pious, in other words, the one that has the most intimate bond with religions, regime had eventually abandoned spiritual power or dismissed the religious chairman. The reason could be civil war from religion conflicts (like France) or the awareness of the threat from bishops.  

2.	Sometimes a common enemy to many tribes can be an aggregation force for all individuals to merge. Like the alliance of hundreds of tribes against the Roman invasion, the threat of external enemy outweighed conflicts between tribes. It couldn’t be denied that Rome's invasion accelerated the conjunction of small groups, but a concerted target can maximize people’s awareness of similarity while ignoring the differences.   
This can be a strategy of cultural unification and association. Both China and France used the same means in national songs, China’s refers to “Arise! Many hearts with one mind, beat the enemy’s bonfire and march on, march on!”, while France’s writing “To arms, citizens, Form your battalions, let’s march!”. By creating an ethnically joint enemy that requires the association of all individuals to resist, regardless of class, ethnic and personal grudge, a fancy feeling can inspire people’s motivation to fight for a more macroscopical goal is created, although imaginary.  
Same manner is implemented in 1984, from George Orwell. It is plausible to assume that Oceania created Eastasia and Eurasia, at least some battle results, to create an altogether target of emotion for people to strengthen the patriotism and weaken egotism. It is convenient and riskless to guide people’s aggressiveness and hostility, as well as other natural, negative feelings, towards an enemy from the outside world, instead of leaving the aggressive impulse develop into crime pointing inside the unity.  
This idea may be rebutted by Socratic or followers of Rousseau and Locke, who claims that human, by nature, is “No one desires evil”, or believes that human’s basic motivation is to respect others’ rights or the repugnance at seeing others’ suffering. However, when faced with a joint army, even the mildest, obedient citizen can be inspired to be the executant of catastrophe. The Auschwitz and the Nanjing Massacre can be convincing evidence of the existence of aggregation.  
In practice, rather than propagandizing the ideology of virtue and mutual kindness, creating an unreal enemy to abreact desires which are incompatible to modern society may be more effective a way to turn barbarians to polite citizens.

This lecture, with the topic of 1789 revolution, discussed details, reasons and consequences about the first revolution. I’m interested in different perspectives and emphasizes from various political parties, including the ambition to create equality but with limits, beginning of new economy, and some regard the revolution as the destruction of tradition. They all explain the political movement insight of own interests.  

Another thing that appears attractive to me is the process of the revolution. Firstly, the people only desired the privileged, namely first and second, to pay taxes the same as the mass population. Even though the first two classes made a concession, the taxation would still be sufficient enough to continue the fiscal system. As time goes by, negotiation failed and political conflict updated and armed forces involved, the revolution turned from a change to a zero-sum game.  

### Comments:  
We can assume that, although by milder method, the anarchy hierarchy can survive longer, fundamental controversies would finally burst out. However, if the nobility hadn’t thrown weapons into political affairs, or if Louis XVI accepted a weakened power instead of fleeing in search for military support, French may develop in a different way, with a nominal king like the UK, and separation of executive, legislative and judicial.   

### Questions:
1.	I’m curious about the different political parties you mentioned at the beginning of the lecture.  
I understand left-wing focus more on personal rights and individual equality, but what about the difference between liberal right-wing and conservative right-wing? Does the “deconstruction of traditions”, referring to the main critics from the conservative right-wing, means that they prefer nostalgias monarchy instead of modern democracy? Also, what does “modern economy” that you mentioned when describing the liberal right wing’s opinion means? Since France have long been benefited by free trade and low tariff, I suppose it means less taxation in the domestic market, as the mass population fought for.  

2.	On p.14, you mentioned “relative weakening of State power since the death of Louis 14th”. Did this weakening come from external threat and internal discontentment, or did this phenomenon come from theories of public philosophers, such as Rosseau and Montesquieu?   
Also, what exactly does this description means? The lack of ability to accumulate taxation?  

3.	On p.7, you mentioned “in the name of traditions and/or new liberal ideas”, does it mean that at that time, tradition and liberty are just different names describing the same thing, namely, with necessary concession, and preserve as much as possible an aristocratic monarchy? Or is the “tradition” means long-existing hierarchy and “liberty” refers to proclaims for equality and respect to individual freedom?  

4.	On p.10, you mentioned that in the “Tiers Etat”, there were no peasants. Were they excluded from the conference? Or were the farmers’ education too inferior to participate? Or they took no interest in such rights-protecting political movement?  

5.	Why the Republican calendar was created in 1792, and why it was cancelled by Napoleon? Is there a ceremonial meaning, just like Japan’s changing era name from “Akihito” to “Reiwa”?  

6.	The fall of Robespierre, according to the lecture, due to a change of majority at the convention nationale. I wonder what was the change and why it happened. Did people begin to be fed with violence and sought for a peaceful transition?
