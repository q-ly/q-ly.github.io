Question：  
Write a short essay (at least 400 words) explaining how Fleck's theory of the growth and development of a scientific fact can be applied to understanding what we mean when we say that it is a fact that the ambient temperature in Tokyo is a certain number of degrees on a certain day.     

Answer：  
Fleck’s basic theory is that scientific facts are produced through ways of thinking and social processes, referring to thought collectives, instead of an individual making an observation.   
Regarding the question, applying Fleck's theory of growth and development of a scientific fact to the certain temperature we read on a certain day, Fleck thought that a scientific fact’s development has the following stages. First, vague visual perception and inadequate initial observation equal to people’s unstandardized exploration of temperature under this question. From 1600 to 1700, scientists tried to define fixed points for a reference in thermodynamics but ended up variously opinioned without a piece of commonly accepted knowledge.    
The second stage, an irrational, concept forming, and style-converting state of experience started from 1776, when a committee was appointed by the Royal Society of London, noticing that pressure and boiling degree both influences temperature; also, in following experiments, people analyzed other variables formerly based on experience, such as the amount of dissolved air in the water, vessel quality, whether or not there is contact to a solid surface to boil, and finally people realized that the temperature of the steam given off by boiling water was more steady than that of the water itself. Although this coincides with modern scientific methods that we use to evaluate evaporation and get the boiling temperature as 100 Celsius, the discovery at that time was more of an experience out of observation rather than theoretical identification.    
Then comes the last stage, developed, reproducible and stylized visual perception form, people invented thermoscope, an instrument that registers changes of temperature but has no fixed, standardized scale. At this stage, the problem of fixing a fixed point is transformed into the problem of manufacture and education. Thermometers were produced, calibrated by thermoscopes, became instruments for standardized measurement, distributed to those educated who can understand the standard, with the help of material network and education.   
The certain temperature number of degrees on a certain day we observed nowadays consists not only devotion from ancient scientists diligent in debates of temperature, laboratory and experiments, but also effect of educators, equipment, material network and theories.    
Scientific fact that we believe in nowadays, is still changing and improving with joint efforts. it is the power of a network consisting of history, industry and science that brings us benefits and conveniences. The simple temperature we read has experiences so long a history of development, as well as we human beings, and finally come to the stage that we are educated to correctly use a standardized thermometer, to read the remarks on this equipment, to believe in the reliability, and to turn signs into a certain number of degrees on this certain day.   



To begin with, Watson and Crick used analog model. When Linus Pauling was working on chemical bonds, he created a physical model, by drawing a polypeptide chain on a strip of paper, which was later folded into a helix, to present the correct form of chemical bonds. In his publishes, Pauling used not only x-ray photos but also a physical model as evidence. The model-building approach, as well as his researching method of α-helix, by x-ray evidence and demonstration with a physical model, inspired Watson and Crick. 
After their meeting, Watson and Crick created a 3-chain model. With the understanding of the mathematical theory of influence on x-rays from helically shaped molecules and chains in the model, Watson and Crick found that number of chains should be between two and four between DNAs. As a result, they began with three chains, conducted a scale model with wire and special metal plates. However, this model was proved to be incorrect because there were not enough places for water to bind with it, due to lack of consideration of how much water was involved, which was a mistake in the theoretical model.

Then, Watson and Crick tried the 2-chain model. After the failure, other scientists continued the research and found that %A = %T, %G = %C in all DNA samples; also, the newly taken x-rays photos showed that DNA has an x-shaped pattern from a helix, coming from Crick’s theory. With the inspiration of like-with-like bases, referring to pair things in nature, Watson and Crick returned to model with two chains, with bases faced inward, paring bases in the inside of two helixes, and changing enol to keto. To create a metal mode, Watson used stiff cardboard to create a scale model and discovered same shape of A-T and G-C, coinciding with the fact that the percentage of Adenine is exactly the same to Thymine, while there is the same amount of Guanine as that of Cytosine in DNA, representing a same shape regardless of different sizes of the bases, and bulges just disappeared.

In the final stage, Watson and Crick used a scale model. After the answer from equipment was proved correct with machine shop, Watson and Crick assembled another scale model from plumb line and a measuring stick, with materially confirmation on the shape of backbones, confirmation from Pauling’s chemical bond that theoretically ensure the correctness of bonds in the model. 
Finally, the model was proven fit with data.
