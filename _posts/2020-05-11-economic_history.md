According to both Thomas Robert Malthus, the population will rise when natural resources are sufficient, and decrease when resources get inadequate. The reason, as Malthus explained, is finite resources couldn’t match up with infinite desires of human beings.  
From today’s lecture, I realize that similar population decline can take place due to epidemic diseases, taking the example of the pandemic period of black death plague, the Spain flu, and this COVID-19.  
Every industrial revolution is accompanied by deaths. At the time of the first one, female spinning workers ended up with disabilities in their senior years due to tiredness; and at the time of the second, miners died because of the poisons from coal, and developments of new transporting machines advance at the cost of lives. If we regard the epidemics as tools, as the professor mentioned in class, regardless caused by human beings or the unpredictable nature, we learn tearful and bloody knowledge, arm ourselves with more advanced science and medical discoveries, then pace off to the next challenge.

People’s understanding  
Sometimes people’s understanding can be misled by biased perspectives. For example, the rumor in Paris in 1841, saying that the cholera appeared because of poisons deliberately spread by the government to fight against the republicans; also, New Yorkers in 1831 believed cholera as a punishment to those who don’t have faith in God. These perspectives, ridiculous as we may think today, were taken as truth by people at that time.  
This remind me of currently doctrine of “Guilty China”, most famously supported by President Trump, attributing all harm caused by corona virus to China. Undoubtedly this is a successful political strategy that brings votes to him for next election, but the afterwards widespread hatred all over the world, towards Chinese and even Asians, shows that people’s views can easily be tricked and shaped.

From this lecture, not only had I learnt about epidemic diseases’ influences can vary from different places, but also reminds me that when Europeans first landed America, not only did they robbed wealth and fetched territory through catastrophes, but also brought epidemic to native Americans. Orientalism and epidemics, rather than weapons, caused greater harm to originals.  
Money and technology were both enough, then labor became the new concern. In industrial revolutions, people turned to machines and new labor-replacements to increase producibility; however, at that time, people turned to slavery, and destructed equality. This lecture also brings me more clearly a point of view of how enormous damage was brought by slavery and slave trade. The population and civilization, after epidemic and human trade, was nearly eliminated.
