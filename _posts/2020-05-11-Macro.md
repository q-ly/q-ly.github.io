## ch1 
### macroeconomic policies
* Fiscal policy: government spending and taxation  
* Monetary policy: growth of money supply; determined by a central bank  

### Classical vs Keynesian
classical (failed in the Great Depression, persistent high unemployment rate, back in 1970s)
* invidible hand: free market, limited role of gov  
* wage & price adjust rapidly -> Eqm  

keynesian (WWII - 1970)
* government intervene (purchase+ demand+) -> full employment
* wage & price adjust slowly -> persistent unemployment rate, market out of Eqm

### long vs short  
long: flexible wages and prices  
short:
* classical: flexible  
* keynesian: sticky

## ch2
### National Income Accounting  

production approach  
market value; final; newly produced; domestical  
* value added = output value - input value
* market value of produced - intermediate usage  

income approach  
* all income (wages & profits)

expenditure approach  
Y = C + I + G + NX
* spending from output users  

fundamental identiy: total production = total income = total expenditure  
* spending from output users  

### exercise 
1.  
for firm A,  
* wage -15k
* tax -5k
* revenue 35k (sell to B 25k, sell to public 10k)  
value added = 35k  
profit = value added - wage = (35k) - 15k = 20k  
after-tax profit = value added - wage - tax = (35k) - 15k - 5k = 15k  

for firm B,  
* wage -10k
* tax -2k
* buy from A -25k
* revenue 40k  
value added = revenue - intermediate = 40k - 25k = 15k  
profit = value added - wage - tax = (40k - 25k) - 10k = 5k  
after-tax profit = value added - wage - tax = (40k - 25k) - 10k - 2k = 3k

(1) production approach: value added. 35k + 15k = 50k  
(2) expenditure approach: public's purchase. 10k + 40k = 50k  
(3) income approach: labor + capital. (15k + 10k) + (20k + 5k) = 50k

2.  
Firm A sells 2k intermediate to firm B, firm B sells 6k final to public. Total GDP contribution?  (6k)  

### GDP, GNP, NFP  
GDP: 国内生产总值，所有人在本国收入  
GNP: 国民生产总值，所有本国人收入  
NFP = GDP - GNP
