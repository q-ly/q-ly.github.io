## ch1 
### macroeconomic policies
* Fiscal policy: government spending and taxation  
* Monetary policy: growth of money supply; determined by a central bank  

### Classical vs Keynesian
classical (failed in the Great Depression, persistent high unemployment rate, back in 1970s)
* invidible hand: free market, limited role of gov  
* wage & price adjust rapidly -> Eqm  

keynesian (WWII - 1970)
* government intervene (purchase+ demand+) -> full employment
* wage & price adjust slowly -> persistent unemployment rate, market out of Eqm

### long vs short  
long: flexible wages and prices  
short:
* classical: flexible  
* keynesian: sticky

## ch2
### National Income Accounting  

production approach  
market value; final; newly produced; domestical  
* value added = output value - input value
* market value of produced - intermediate usage  

income approach  
* all income (wages & profits)

expenditure approach  
Y = C + I + G + NX
* spending from output users  

fundamental identiy: total production = total income = total expenditure  
* spending from output users  

### exercise 
1.  
for firm A,  
* wage -15k
* tax -5k
* revenue 35k (sell to B 25k, sell to public 10k)  
value added = 35k  
profit = value added - wage = (35k) - 15k = 20k  
after-tax profit = value added - wage - tax = (35k) - 15k - 5k = 15k  

for firm B,  
* wage -10k
* tax -2k
* buy from A -25k
* revenue 40k  
value added = revenue - intermediate = 40k - 25k = 15k  
profit = value added - wage - tax = (40k - 25k) - 10k = 5k  
after-tax profit = value added - wage - tax = (40k - 25k) - 10k - 2k = 3k

(1) production approach: value added. 35k + 15k = 50k  
(2) expenditure approach: public's purchase. 10k + 40k = 50k  
(3) income approach: labor + capital. (15k + 10k) + (20k + 5k) = 50k

2.  
Firm A sells 2k intermediate to firm B, firm B sells 6k final to public. Total GDP contribution?  (6k)  

### GDP, GNP, NFP  
GDP: 国内生产总值，所有人在本国收入  
GNP: 国民生产总值，所有本国人收入  
NFP = GDP - GNP  

### Indices


| difference | GDP deflator | CPI |
| ---------- | ------------ | --- |
| measurement | 100 * Nominal/Real | 100 * current price/base price |
| content | investment, consumption, etc | daily consumption |
| range | domestic | global |
| items | changable | fixed basket |

### inflation
π = 100*(Pt+1 - Pt)/Pt

### interest rate
nominal = i  
real = i - π
expected real = i - πe  
* expected > actual: borrower +  
* expected < actual: lender +  

### aggregate saving  
saving = income - spent  
Spvt = private disposable income - consumption = (Y + NFP + TR + INT - T) - C  
Sgov = net government income - government purchases = (T - TR - INT) - G  
S = Spvt + Sgov = Y + NFP - C - G = GNP - C - G = I + NX + NFP = I + CA  

## ch3
### production function
Y = A * F(K, N)  
k: Marginal Product of Capital (MPK) = ∆Y/∆K  
k+ MPK-  

### labor demand: W/P = MPN
W/P: marginal cost of having additional worker; wage fixed in labor market    
MPN: value of having additional worket; ∆Y/∆N  
keep hiring (change N) until real wage = W/P = MPN
* supply shock (A)
* capital size (K)  

### labor supply
substitution effect: wage+, work+  
income effect: wage+, work-  
* wealth
* expected future real wage

### labor market Eqm
ND = NS  
adverse supply shock: A- -> Y- -> MPN- -> ND-, w- -> Y-  

### unemployment
frictional & structural  
labor force = employed + unemployed  
population = labor force + not in the labor force  
unemployment rate = unempolyed / labor force  
-u = (frictional + structural) unemployment  
actual u = cyclical + -u  
Okun's law: (-Y - Y) / -Y = 2(-u - u)


## ch4
### saving
Sd = Y - Cd - G  
Y++ -> C+, Sd+  
future income+ -> Cd+ -> S-  
i+  
* substitution effect: Sd+  
* income effect: borrower borrow+, saver save-  
empirically, i+, Sd+  
### fiscal policy  
通过影响G，影响当前和预期收入，影响消费  
G+ tax+ Cd- Sd-(income-, substitute+, income>substitute)
