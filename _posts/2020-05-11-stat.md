### Experiment: 控制变量 high internal validity; low external validity  
Isolate the effect of treatment on outcome  

#### SATE: Sample (subset used in the study) Average Treatment Effect (SATE)  
Estimate casual effect of treatment within sample  
SATE = $ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n ${$ \mathbf{Y}_{i} $(1) - $ \mathbf{Y}_{i} $(0)}  
Fundamental problem of casual inference: only 1 of 2 potential outcomes;  
impossible to match on every single factors except treatment -> Impossible to calculate.  
Confounding variables -> bias in treatment assignment -> invalid inference  
		
#### RCT: Randomized Controlled Trials
Guarantee: unconfoundedness  
Difference in the sample means estimator  
D = $\frac{1}$|{$\mathbf{T}_{i}$=1}|  
¥[1/(NUMBERS of Treated units) * (Treated outcomes)] - [1/(NUMBERS of Controlled units) * (Controlled outcomes)]
