## experimental and observable

### Experiment: 控制变量 high internal validity; low external validity  
Isolate the effect of treatment on outcome  

#### SATE: Sample (subset used in the study) Average Treatment Effect (SATE)  
Estimate casual effect of treatment within sample  
SATE = $ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n ${$ \mathbf{Y}\_{i} $(1) - $ \mathbf{Y}\_{i} $(0)}  

Fundamental problem of casual inference:  
* only 1 of 2 potential outcomes;  
* impossible to match on every single factors except treatment  
* impossible to calculate.  

Confounding variables -> bias in treatment assignment -> invalid inference  
		
#### RCT: Randomized Controlled Trials
Guarantee unconfoundedness  
Difference in the sample means estimator  
D = $\frac{1}{|\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 1|}$  $\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ ($\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 1$)- $\frac{1}{|\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 0|}$  $\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ ($\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 0$)  
[1/(NUMBERS of Treated units) * (Treated outcomes)] - [1/(NUMBERS of Controlled units) * (Controlled outcomes)]


### Observation: 单纯观察
Bias: observe unbalanced pre-treatment variables (affect both treatment status & outcome)  
-> Find comparison group (treatment and control group comparable on everything except treatment)  
#### Cross-sectional comparison 两个after
Treated and controlled are similar except treatement
SATE  
Guarantee: balance in pretreatment variables  
D = $\frac{1}{|\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 1|}$  $\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ ($\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 1$)- $\frac{1}{|\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 0|}$  $\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ ($\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 0$)  
[1/(NUMBERS of Treated after) * (Treated after)] - [(NUMBERS of Controlled after) * (Controlled after)]
> mean(Treated after) - mean(Controlled after)
		
#### Before-and-after 实验组前后对比
different confounder between treated and controlled  
SATE  
D = $\frac{1}{|\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 1|}$  $\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ ($\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 1$)- $\frac{1}{|\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 0|}$  $\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ ($\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 0$)  
[1/(Treated after) * (Treated after)] - [1/(Treated before) * (Treated before)]  
> mean(Treated after) - mean(Treated before)
	
#### Difference-in-difference 双重差分
Control time-varying confounders with parallel time trend 从对照组提取理论Y  
SATT: Sample Average Treatment Effect for the Treated  
[Y(Treated after) - Y(Treated before)] - [Y(Controlled after) - Y(Controlled before)] = (difference for treatment group) - (difference for controlled group)  
> [mean(Treated after) - mean(Treated before)] - [mean(Controlled after) - mean(Controlled before)]


## Survey Sampling
Target population (TP)
Sample population (SP)
sampling fram: complete list of potential responders
sample selection Bias: sample selection bias. Sample not being representative of TP


Probability sampling (>non-probability): every unit in TP has ≠0 chance of being sampled (representativeness)  
Simple random sampling: Predetermined number sampled with each potential respondent having 【equal chance】 of being sampled  
done without replacement (at most one interview per person)  
Quota sampling
