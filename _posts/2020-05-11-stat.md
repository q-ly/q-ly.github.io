## experimental and observable

### Experiment: 控制变量 high internal validity; low external validity  
Isolate the effect of treatment on outcome  

#### SATE: Sample (subset used in the study) Average Treatment Effect (SATE)  
Estimate casual effect of treatment within sample  
SATE = $ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n ${$ \mathbf{Y}\_{i} $(1) - $ \mathbf{Y}\_{i} $(0)}  

Fundamental problem of casual inference:  
* only 1 of 2 potential outcomes;  
* impossible to match on every single factors except treatment  
* impossible to calculate.  

Confounding variables -> bias in treatment assignment -> invalid inference  
		
#### RCT: Randomized Controlled Trials
Guarantee unconfoundedness  
Difference in the sample means estimator  

D = 
$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{T}\_{i} = 1|}$  


\sum_{i}^\mathbf{Y}\_{i} $  

\in {\mathbf{T}\_{i}=1}} \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ - $\frac{1}\mathbf{T}\_{i}=0|} \sum_{i \in {\mathbf{T}\_{i}=0}} \mathbf{Y}\_{i}$ 

\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \Gamma (m + \alpha + 1)} 

¥[1/(NUMBERS of Treated units) * (Treated outcomes)] - [1/(NUMBERS of Controlled units) * (Controlled outcomes)]


### Observation: 单纯观察
Bias: observe unbalanced pre-treatment variables (affect both treatment status & outcome)  
-> Find comparison group (treatment and control group comparable on everything except treatment)  
#### Cross-sectional comparison 两个after
Treated and controlled are similar except treatement
SATE
Guarantee: balance in pretreatment variables

[1/(NUMBERS of Treated after) * (Treated after)] - [(NUMBERS of Controlled after) * (Controlled after)]
		mean(Treated after) - mean(Controlled after)
		
#### Before-and-after 实验组前后对比
different confounder between treated and controlled  
SATE  
[1/(Treated after) * (Treated after)] - [1/(Treated before) * (Treated before)]  
mean(Treated after) - mean(Treated before)  
	
	Difference-in-difference 双重差分
		Control time-varying confounders with parallel time trend 从对照组提取理论Y
		SATT: Sample Average Treatment Effect for the Treated
		
			[Y(Treated after) - Y(Treated before)] - [Y(Controlled after) - Y(Controlled before)]
			= (difference for treatment group) - (difference for controlled group)
		[mean(Treated after) - mean(Treated before)] - [mean(Controlled after) - mean(Controlled before)]
